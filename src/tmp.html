<p>A <span><strong>singleton set</strong></span> (or just a <span><strong>singleton</strong></span>) is a set with <span><em>exactly one</em></span> element. There is "essentially just one" singleton set. This a very different situation than that for the <span><strong>empty set</strong></span>, where we know there’s <span><em>exactly one</em></span> empty set. Why does this happen? How does this happen? We try to explain this.</p>
<h1 id="any-two-singleton-sets-are-essentially-the-same">Any two singleton sets are "essentially the same"</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\tab\)</span> <span><strong>Definition</strong></span>. A <span><strong>set-isomorphism</strong></span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection"><strong>bijection</strong></a> between sets.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\tab\)</span> <span><strong>Theorem</strong></span>. There exists a unique set-isomorphism between any two singleton sets. There’s "exactly one" singleton set, not necessarily because any two singleton sets have the same elements (which is how <span><strong>equality</strong></span> of sets is defined), but because, given any two singleton sets, there’s exactly one set-isomorphism (ie. a bijection) between the two. This allows us to say there’s "exactly one" singleton set even when there <span><em>really</em></span> isn’t exactly one singleton set. In other words, this allows us to say there’s a <span><em>unique</em></span> singleton set, provided we’re willing to consider two singletons sets "the same" whenever there exists a unique set-isomorphism between the two. The jargon for this is: there’s a unique singleton set, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to">up to</a> unique set-isomorphism.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\tab\)</span> <span><em>Proof</em></span>. Why do we talk about "the" singleton set? Is there <span><em>only one</em></span> singleton set? For instance, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality"><strong>axiom of extension</strong></a> (aka. the axiom of extensionality), we can prove that there’s only one empty set. This is because the axiom of extension says that <span><em>equality of sets</em></span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if"><strong>materially equivalent</strong></a> to <span><em>equality of their elements</em></span>. More precisely, two sets are equal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional"><strong>IFF</strong></a> they have exactly the same elements. If there were two empty sets, then for them to be not equal they’d have to differ by (at least) one element: one of the two empty sets would have to have an element that is not in the other. But this can’t happen because an empty set has, by definition, no elements.</p>
<p>So, what about singleton sets? There’s certainly more than one, because, for instance, the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> is not the same as the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>: the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> has the one element <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and the set <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> has the one element <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is <span><em>not</em></span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, under <span><em>most</em></span> reasonable interpretations of the symbol <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the symbol <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (for example, in the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/trivial+ring">zero ring</a>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> <span><em>does</em></span> equal <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>).</p>
<p>But these two sets are <span><strong>set-isomorphic</strong></span>: there exists a <span><strong>set-isomorphism</strong></span> (ie. a <span><strong>bijection</strong></span>) between the two. What does a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> look like? Well, for starters, what does a <span><strong>function</strong></span> between <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> look like? Consider a function <span class="math inline">\(f: \{0\} \to \{1\}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>. By definition, the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must map each element of <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> to exactly one element of <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> has exactly one element, namely <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so all we need to decide is: what is the image of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>? In other words, what is <span class="math inline">\(f[0]\)</span>? Well, how many choices do we have? For each element of <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> we have one choice, and each choice leads to a different function. But <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> only has one elements, namely <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, so there’s only one choice: the only possible answer is that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must map <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, meaning <span class="math inline">\(f: 0 \mapsto 1\)</span> or equivalently <span class="math inline">\(f[0] = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, there’s only one function from <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>. And this function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is very special: it’s a <span><em>bijection</em></span>. Why is <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> a bijection? Because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an <span><strong>injection</strong></span> (distinct elements of <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> go to distinct elements of <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>), and because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a <span><strong>surjection</strong></span> (every element of <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> is the image of at least one element of <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span>). So, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an <span><strong>isomorphism of sets</strong></span>.</p>
<p>And, since there’s <span><em>only one</em></span> function from <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span>, this bijection/set-isomorphism is <span><em>unique</em></span>. This is very important, so let’s say it again: <span><em>there’s a unique set-isomorphism from <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span></em></span>. But when arguing this way we never used any specific properties of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. All we used was the fact that the sets <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> have <span><em>exactly one</em></span> element. So, the same argument applies to any two sets with exactly one element (any two <span><strong>singleton</strong></span> sets). How?</p>
<p>Well, let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be an arbitrary (but fixed) singleton set, and let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be an arbitrary (but fixed) singleton set.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a singleton set, we can write <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span>, where the symbol <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is an arbitrary label for whatever element the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> happens to contain.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a singleton set, we can write <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>, where the symbol <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is an arbitrary label for whatever element the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> happens to contain.<br />
If it happens that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> have exactly the same elements, and it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> (by the <span><strong>axiom of extension</strong></span>).</p>
<p>If it happens that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does <span><em>not</em></span> equal <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> don’t have exactly the same elements, and it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> does <span><em>not</em></span> equal <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> (by the <span><strong>axiom of extension</strong></span>). Still, we claim there’s a unique set-isomorphism between <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>. To see this, let <span class="math inline">\(f: \{a\} \to \{b\}\)</span> be a <span><strong>function</strong></span> from <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>. By the definition of function, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must map each element of <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> to exactly one element of <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> has exactly one element (namely, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> has exactly one element (namely, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>), so the only possible function is <span class="math inline">\(f : a \mapsto b\)</span>, which is the function that maps <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This function is both an <span><strong>injection</strong></span> (distinct elements of <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> go to distinct elements of <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>) and a <span><strong>surjection</strong></span> (every element of <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> is the image of at least one element of <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span>). So, it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(f: a \mapsto b\)</span> is a <span><strong>bijection</strong></span>. Single <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the only possible function from <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>, this bijection is <span><em>unique</em></span>. But a bijection is, by definition, a <span><strong>set-isomorphism</strong></span> (aka. an isomorphism of sets). So, <span><em>there’s a unique set-isomorphism</em></span> from <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{b\}\)</span> are arbitrary singleton sets, it follows that there’s a unique set-isomorphism between any two singleton sets.<br />
